# Cellular Automaton

This is a basic prototype library to run cellular automata *a la Conway*. He kinda hated his eponymous game, incidentally.

# Example

The library comes with a simple example automaton which runs on the command line. To run it, check out the repo (and having a recent version of [go](www.golang.org) installed) and type:
```shell
go build conway 
```
An then run the executable that was created *conway.exe* or *conway*, depending on whether you are using windows or not.

To run the tests instead, type:
```shell
go test conway
```

The otherwise not very pyrotechnic output is meant for a modern Windows terminal window; if that does not seem to render very well, the size of the world can be adjusted in *main.go* 

# Go, why go?

I am in the process of learning it. This could be terribly sophomoric code for a master *goista*, but it is at the very least, sporty.
